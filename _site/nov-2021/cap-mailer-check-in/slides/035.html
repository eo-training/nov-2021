<meta name="description" content="VERIS can be used to track the status of an individual voter’s ballot as it winds its way through the absentee ballot process. After a voter’s absentee voting application has been processed, VERIS indicates that a ballot is “Issued”. When a ballot is received from a voter, the “issued” status in VERIS is updated to “marked”. Finally, when it is determined that the correct authorized absentee voter completed the voter statement AND that no material omissions are present, the “Marked” status is updated to “Pre-Processed.” As mailer check-in staff, you are responsible for updating a voter’s ballot status to “Marked” for the day the ballot was received. Then you are responsible for updating that voter’s ballot status to “Pre-Processed” if there are no material omissions. There are two ways to update a ballot status in VERIS depending on whether there is a scannable barcode on the voter’s information label. We are going to begin our discussion with the batch scanning method. Batch scanning is used when your set of mailers all have scannable bar codes, typically domestic and UOCAVA submissions. This is the method you will use most often. If done properly, batch scanning is very efficient. To begin batch scanning, log into VERIS and land on the VERIS home page. Place the cursor over “Absentee” on the navigation bar. Then select “AB Batch Receipt – without IDs” from the drop-down menu." />

	<p>VERIS can be used to track the status of an individual voter’s ballot as it winds its way through the absentee ballot process. After a voter’s absentee voting application has been processed, VERIS indicates that a ballot is “Issued”. When a ballot is received from a voter, the “issued” status in VERIS is updated to “marked”. Finally, when it is determined that the correct authorized absentee voter completed the voter statement AND that no material omissions are present, the “Marked” status is updated to “Pre-Processed.”</p>

<p>As mailer check-in staff, you are responsible for updating a voter’s ballot status to “Marked” for the day the ballot was received. Then you are responsible for updating that voter’s ballot status to “Pre-Processed” if there are no material omissions.</p>
