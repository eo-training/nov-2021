        <p>Welcome to the Fairfax County Office of Elections Central Absentee Precinct’s online training class for Mailer Check-In.</p>

<p>Beginning with the November 2021 election, Mailer Check-In will replace what was formerly known as “preprocessing”. Experienced preprocessors will note a number of important operational changes.</p>

<p>This course is designed to provide both new and returning staff with the knowledge required to successfully participate in the Mailer Check-in operation.</p>

<p>Please take some time to review this online training. As always, we welcome your questions and comments; we hope you will share any insights you may have as you participate in this class.</p>

        <p>In advance of the November 2, 2021 Elections, it is important that you are aware of the county’s Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Fairfax County remains focused on providing a safe, supportive, and healthy work environment and is continuously revising and updating its COVID-19 guidelines. The Office of Elections will ensure that applicable information regarding any changes is passed on to staff before operations begin. We are currently waiting for final directives from the county regarding the COVID-19 vaccination and testing mandates.</p>

<p>The county continues to require that all staff be masked. A face shield may be worn over a mask but may not be worn in place of a mask.</p>

<p>The Office of Elections will supply gloves, face masks, and hand sanitizer as well as surface cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>Of course, in order to protect the health of others, if you are ill, please stay home. If you become ill while on the job, you will be sent home.</p>

        <p>Please take a moment to review these principles.</p>

<p>As we plan for and conduct each election, we follow these four guiding principles to maintain the integrity of the election. These principles direct each step and action we take.</p>

<p>It is important for you, as members of the mailer check-in staff, to read, understand, and embody these principles, to perform all duties assigned to you by the Office of Elections, and to do so faithfully, diligently, and impartially.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>005. : Slide 5</strong></p> -->

        <p>CAP stands for <strong>Central Absentee Precinct</strong>. CAP is responsible for all ballots submitted prior to election day.</p>

<p>There are two ways a voter may submit a ballot prior to election day:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A voter may request an absentee ballot and return their ballot by mail or at a drop box location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A voter may vote in person at a satellite location.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, there are two separate and distinct CAP operations.</p>

<p>For Absentee Ballots received by-mail or drop box:</p>

<p>CAP is responsible for processing and counting mail-in and drop box voter submissions. These operations begin prior to election day, continue on election day, and go through noon on the Friday after election day. Post-election day processing handles mail-in voter submissions, postmarked by election day, but not received until after election day. All CAP processing operations take place at the Fairfax County Government Center.</p>

<p>For In-Person Absentee Voting:</p>

<p>Fairfax County voters may vote early, up to 45 days in advance of election day, at any one of multiple satellite locations set up throughout the county. A voter arrives at a satellite location, receives a ballot, marks their choices on the ballot, and then places the ballot in an on-site digital scanner. On election day, CAP staff is responsible for submitting the final report which includes the satellite location voting results as well as the number of in-person absentee voters and ballots.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>006. : Slide 6</strong></p> -->

        <p>One of CAP’s main objectives is to fairly adjudicate the mail-in and drop box submissions of Fairfax County voters as well as to scrupulously account for their ballots and their votes. Mailer Check-In is an integral element of this operation.</p>

<p>In accordance with state law, authorized absentee voter submissions may be processed by CAP staff. This procedure entails:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evaluating the voter submissions returned by mail or drop box</li>
  <li>checking voters into VERIS (the state-wide data base)</li>
</ul>

<p>Check-in results are ultimately included in the Statement of Results (SOR) on election day.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>008. : Slide 8</strong></p> -->

        <p><strong>Hours of service:</strong> The schedule of operations is based on the volume of mailed-in and drop box voter submissions. The projected start date is Friday, October 1st but this date may change as the election nears. Staff will be advised of the overall schedule as soon as the Office of Elections understands the anticipated volume of ballots.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that scheduling and assignment flexibility is key! You may or may not be assigned on any given day. We ask you to remain happily flexible! You know the routine…it all depends on the mail!</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Mailer Check-In will take place at the Fairfax County Government Center, room 120C. Enter through the cafeteria dining area; proceed to the back left.</p>

<p><strong>What to wear:</strong> Business casual and clean, unripped jeans are acceptable. Wear layers as the temperature in the Government Center can vary. No overt political commentary is allowed on clothing or jewelry.</p>

<p><strong>What to bring:</strong> You should bring snacks, beverages, water, etc. The Government Center cafeteria is open from 7:00 AM until 1:30 PM with a limited menu. You may bring electronic devices such as a phone or tablet, but you may not use them while at the processing workstations.</p>

<p><strong>Payment:</strong> Mailer check-in staff are non-merit, temporary employees of Fairfax County. These are hourly wage positions, paid at the S-9 rate, and do not include Fairfax County benefits such as sick or annual leave or participation in the Fairfax County insurance or retirement programs. Processors will be required to record hours on a payroll time sheet.</p>

<p>As temporary employees of Fairfax County, you are required to wear your county identification badge at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Training Manual:</strong> You are encouraged to consult the Mailer Check-In Manual for more detailed information about processes and procedures. We will send you a link for a downloadable copy once the file is available <strong>.</strong></p>

        <p>One team leader is responsible for overseeing all operations, ensuring that mailer check-in procedures are followed. The team leader is further responsible for managing the daily paperwork and ensuring that voter submissions are properly secured at the end of each day.</p>

<p>Mailer check-in staff are responsible for correctly checking-in mailers from absentee voters returned by mail or drop box.</p>

<p>Authorized representatives and other observers may be present in the mailer check-in workroom. Authorized representatives are party or candidate representatives with written authorization. They are authorized to hear and observe processing activities but may not interfere with the orderly conduct of the operation, touch/handle any mailer, or examine information on the VERIS computer screens.</p>

        <p>The main functions of mailer check-In staff include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reviewing mailers to remove any mis-sorted mailer types (digital or email) and unused or undeliverable submissions.</li>
  <li>Examining mailers to ensure that an authorized voter has provided a correct and complete voter statement and then making an important determination: to “process” or “not process.”</li>
  <li>Locating a voter in VERIS</li>
  <li>Updating a voter’s ballot status.</li>
  <li>Managing mailers</li>
  <li>Maintaining the Mailer Count worksheet.</li>
</ul>

<p>During this training, we provide the “best practices” to accomplish each function of the mailer check-in operation. These “best practices” will serve as a roadmap to effectiveness and efficiency within the framework of election integrity.</p>

At the end of the day, the team leader will compile all the checked-in totals to determine a daily grand total. It is the responsibility of every staff member to ensure that the Mailer Count worksheet is completed accurately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Material Omissions Chart: The Material Omissions chart is a comprehensive, user-friendly table outlining acceptable/unacceptable standards for the review of voter statements. A material omission is a voter’s failure to provide complete and correct information in his voter statement or a failure to properly submit his/her ballot. Such actions may render that ballot unqualified for counting.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As mailer check-in staff, you are expected to make important decisions regarding the acceptance of a voter’s ballot based on the information provided in the voter statement These decisions must be made fairly and consistently. If there is any question about the information in a voter statement, the answer can usually be found in the Material Omissions chart.</p>

<p>However, if you are ever in doubt, ask the team leader.</p>

        <p>For returning preprocessors, you will find a number of changes to operations for the upcoming election.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the past, preprocessing was always conducted by teams of two staff members: A Ballot Officer and a VERIS Officer. This is no longer required. One staff member will now carry out both functions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The typical voter submission, an outer mailer containing a B envelope containing a ballot, is history! There is a new return mailer, and it does double duty. The front side of the return mailer contains the Office of Elections address. The reverse side of the return mailer contains the voter information label AND the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> (or voter statement), eliminating the need for a separate B envelope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mailer check-in now includes an added step in VERIS. You will be required to update a voter’s ballot status in VERIS to “Marked” before updating the status to “Pre-Processed”. Previously, this function was handled by the Mail Intake Team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mailer check-in staff no longer removes ballots from mailers. This function will be completed at a different time by different staff members.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These changes have been instituted so that the entire CAP operation can function more efficiently. However, there is NO change to what is expected of processors: a compliance with operational procedures, an attention to detail, and a focus on accuracy.</p>

        <p>On election day, when a voter arrives at the polling location, the voter provides his/her name and address, and presents identification, all before casting a ballot. Of course, the process is very different for an authorized absentee voter who is submitting a ballot by mail or in a drop box.</p>

<p>An authorized absentee voter who is taking advantage of the Vote By Mail option must return a voter submission that typically contains two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A return mailer. The return mailer includes the Office of Elections address on the front. The voter information label and <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> is on the reverse side.</li>
  <li>A ballot inside the return mailer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mailers may look different based on the status and location of the voter.</p>

<p>For mailer check-in staff, the return mailer is critical. The mailer represents the absentee voter. On the mailer, the voter is stating his/her name and address. In lieu of presenting identification, the voter provides a signature attesting that the information is correct.</p>

<p>Note that in some cases, a voter must provide additional documentation. We will discuss these specific instances later.</p>

        <p>This image is an example of the most common type of return mailer submission: the Domestic Ballot Return Mailer. The front of the mailer includes the preprinted address of the Fairfax County Office of Elections.</p>

<p>The voter places a completed digital ballot in the mailer. Digital ballots are pre-printed ballots on heavy stock issued by the Office of Elections that can be read by a digital scan machine.</p>

<p>Notice the pink circle with the plus sign within. This icon represents an actual hole in the return mailer and is a tactile marker. It is used by voters that may need assistance to ensure that their ballot is sent back to the Office of Elections in the correct envelope.</p>

        <p>The voter information label and <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> is printed on the reverse side of the return mailer. This has eliminated the need for a separate B Envelope.</p>

<p>The information on the reverse side of the return mailer is very important:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note the voter information label circled in red. This label contains identifying information about the authorized absentee voter, including the voter’s name, address, voter ID #, and unique scannable barcode. The label also specifies the current election as well as the voter’s congressional district (CD) and precinct. The label may also include the letters “NA” if a Request for Assistance form must be submitted by the voter.</li>
  <li>This same voter must complete the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> located beneath the label.</li>
  <li>As processors, you will review the information both on the voter information label and the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> to determine if the correct authorized absentee voter has mailed in the ballot and if any material omissions are present.</li>

        <p>A critical mailer check-in task is to verify that the authorized absentee voter has completed the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em>. Therefore, it is very important that the voter’s name and address on the voter information label match the information provided by the voter on the mailer.</p>

<p>Typically, the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> and the voter information label will contain the same voter information…but not always.</p>

<p>If you encounter a mismatch between the voter information label and the voter’s statement, do not process this ballot. Place the mailer in the “Not Processed” table box.</p>

        <p>Once you are sure that the authorized absentee voter has completed the voter statement (i.e., the voter information label and the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> information agree), the voter statement must be reviewed for material omissions.</p>

<ol>

        <p>Let’s take a moment to discuss what is acceptable in the name field. To demonstrate, we will use a voter named Robert Matthew Jones. Robert Matthew Jones is the name that will appear on the voter information label.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The voter must include the full first name and full last name. For example: Robert Jones.
 However, a voter may provide only the initial of the first name if a full middle name is included. For example: R. Matthew Jones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The voter may include a name in an order different from “first, middle, last”. For example: Jones, Robert.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A middle name is not required, or a middle initial may be substituted. For example: Robert M. Jones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A voter may provide a recognized nickname. For example: Bob Jones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be cautious when generational suffixes (Jr., Sr., I, II, III) are included. Ensure that you are checking in the correct voter.</p>

<p>Your goal is to positively identify the voter to the best of your ability.</p>

<p>However, during operations, you will encounter various other types of mailers. It is important that you familiarize yourself with all the different types of voter submissions. There are different requirements and mailer check-in procedures relevant to each type.</p>

<p>A UOCAVA submission is sent to the Office of Elections by an authorized absentee voter who is living overseas or by military personnel living anywhere.</p>

        <p>Some voters have indicated on their absentee ballot applications that they will need assistance to complete their voter statements and/or to mark their ballots. The letters NA (Needs Assistance) will appear on the right side of the voter information label.</p>

<p>If assistance is requested, the voter will receive a blue “Request for Assistance” form. In most cases, a completed blue form will be returned in the mailer along with the ballot. If you see the NA designation on a voter’s information label, do NOT process this mailer. Place the mailer in the “Not Processed” table box.</p>

<p>Of course, there is always an exception!</p>

<p>When reviewing the return mailer of a Needs Assistance (NA) voter, you may observe that the voter actually signed the voter statement. Perhaps this voter no longer needs assistance or the original request for the form was made in error. If the voter signed the voter statement, a Request for Assistance form is NOT required. In this case, the mailer may be checked in. You, of course, must ensure that the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> is completed correctly with no material omissions.</p>

        <p>Virginia state law offers an absentee voter the opportunity to correct a material omission on the voter statement. If a voter has provided incorrect or incomplete information on the voter statement that would cause the ballot to be disallowed, the Office of Elections will notify the voter of the material omission and further stipulate how to correct the issue so the ballot may be counted. This is called the “curing” process.</p>

<p>Some absentee voters may opt to come, in person, to the Office of Elections to “cure” their submission.</p>

<p>Others may choose to provide (by mail or email), a signed affidavit containing the corrected information. When this affidavit arrives at the Office of Elections it will be placed with the voter’s original mailer. In this case, you may review the information in the affidavit for material omissions and use the affidavit information to check in the voter on VERIS.</p>

<p>Note that it may be necessary to review the affidavit in conjunction with the original voter statement. For example, if the voter forgot the city or zip code on the original voter statement and then submitted an affidavit with only the corrected city or zip code, you may look at both components to determine completeness.</p>

        <p>The Office of Elections staff reviews and sorts mailers as they arrive at the Government Center. They attach an appropriate sticker and set aside any unused voter packets, Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots (FWABs), and voided mailers. Typically, these will not be seen by the mailer check-in staff.</p>

<p>However, if one slips into one of your trays of mailers, place it in the “Not Processed” table box. Do not attempt to find this voter in VERIS or to process the ballot.</p>

        <p>To begin, let’s discuss VERIS.</p>

<p>The Virginia Election and Registration Information System (VERIS) is a database that contains highly sensitive information about all registered voters throughout the state of Virginia. As such, it is crucial that this information be protected and not shared with others who do not have a need to know. VERIS voter data is only to be used in CAP in the execution of your role as a member of the mailer check-in staff.</p>

<p>FYI: When accessing and using the VERIS system you will be asked to consent to system monitoring for law enforcement and other purposes. Unauthorized use of this computer system may subject you to State or Federal criminal prosecution and penalties.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>035. : Slide 35</strong></p> -->

        <p>VERIS can be used to track the status of an individual voter’s ballot as it winds its way through the absentee ballot process. After a voter’s absentee voting application has been processed, VERIS indicates that a ballot is “Issued”. When a ballot is received from a voter, the “issued” status in VERIS is updated to “marked”. Finally, when it is determined that the correct authorized absentee voter completed the voter statement AND that no material omissions are present, the “Marked” status is updated to “Pre-Processed.”</p>

<p>As mailer check-in staff, you are responsible for updating a voter’s ballot status to “Marked” for the day the ballot was received. Then you are responsible for updating that voter’s ballot status to “Pre-Processed” if there are no material omissions.</p>

<p>There are two ways to update a ballot status in VERIS depending on whether there is a scannable barcode on the voter’s information label.</p>

<p>We are going to begin our discussion with the <strong>batch scanning</strong> method. Batch scanning is used when your set of mailers all have scannable bar codes, typically domestic and UOCAVA submissions. This is the method you will use most often. If done properly, batch scanning is very efficient.</p>

<p>To begin batch scanning, log into VERIS and land on the VERIS home page. Place the cursor over “Absentee” on the navigation bar. Then select “AB Batch Receipt – without IDs” from the drop-down menu.</p>


    </div>

  <div class="slide-summary">

      <div class="slide-image">

        <!-- <p><strong>036. : Slide 36</strong></p> -->

        <p>Once you’ve clicked on “All batch receipt-without IDs”, the <em>Date Received</em> and <em>Received by Method</em> fields should appear. <em>Date Received</em> defaults to the current date. The date can be changed as needed by clicking on the calendar icon to the right of the date received box. For example, if you’re checking in mail received earlier in the week, use the calendar icon to the right of the box and click on the appropriate date.</p>

<p>For the <em>Received by Method</em>, click on the arrow to the right of the box to select the appropriate method of receipt. If scanning mailers delivered by USPS, FEDEX, DHL or UPS select “Mail”. If scanning drop box return mailers, select “Drop-off”.</p>

<p>Make sure to select the appropriate <em>Received by Method</em> based on whether the return mailers were received by mail or from voter drop box locations. If you are unsure, check with the team leader.</p>

<p>When the information in both fields is correct, you’re ready to begin batch scanning the return mailers.</p>

<p>But there are some important steps that must be followed before you can actually put the scanner to the mailer.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>037. : Slide 37</strong></p> -->

        <p>Step 1. Ensure that the VERIS screen shows the <em>Received Date</em> and the <em>Received By Method</em> fields.</p>

<p>Step 2. The team leader provides a red tray, containing domestic and/or UOCAVA mailers. All mailers will have scannable barcodes. The red tray will be labeled with the correct <em>Received Date</em>. Change the date in VERIS to the date indicated on the red tray. Red trays will contain mailers that have been received by the same method. Ensure that the VERIS <em>Received by Method</em> is correct.</p>

<p>Step 3. Count out a set of 50 mailers, then quickly “eyeball” each mailer in the set and remove any email ballots (because these do not have scannable bar codes) and any Unused mailers. Place these in the “Not Processed” table box.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>038. : Slide 38</strong></p> -->

        <p>Step 4. You must now meticulously evaluate each mailer to determine if the correct authorized absentee voter sent in the ballot AND to determine if the voter statement contains any material omissions. To accomplish this:</p>

<p>a. Compare the name and address on the <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> to the name and address on the voter information label. This includes generational suffixes. Place any mismatches in the “Not Processed” table box.</p>

<p>b. Examine the voter statement for material omissions. If material omissions are present, place the mailer in the “Not Processed” table box.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review voter information label for special circumstances: Needs Assistance (NA).</li>
</ul>

<p>Does the voter information label indicate Needs Assistance (“NA”)? The mailer may include a blue Request for Assistance form. Remember, you may not open the mailer to check for the blue form; however, you may see the blue form through the hole in the return mailer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the information label indicates “NA”, place mailer in the “Not Processed” table box.</li>
  <li>If the voter signed the voter statement and the voter statement contains no material omissions, then, the mailer may be checked-in.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="slide-summary">

        <!-- <p><strong>039. : Slide 39</strong></p> -->

        <p>Now you have a set of approximately 50 mailers in front of you. You have verified that the information label matches the voter statement <strong>and</strong> you have determined that the voter statement is complete (with no material omissions) on each of the mailers. It is time to begin scanning.</p>

<p>Step 5. Select the first mailer from the set. Scan the barcode on the voter information label.</p>

<p>Some important scanning particulars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Position the head of the scanner level and close to the table.</li>
  <li>Be sure to only take hold of one mailer at a time and carefully slide the mailer under the scanner beam. Listen for a “success” beep.</li>
  <li>Then, cautiously remove the mailer out from under the scanner beam. Overly hurried, random movements often cause a mailer to be re-scanned by mistake. You do not want to hear a second beep! Take your time…scan mailers carefully and deliberately.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="slide-summary">

      <div class="slide-image">
        
        <a href="/nov-2021/cap-mailer-check-in/slides/040">

        <!-- <p><strong>040. : Slide 40</strong></p> -->

        <p>After scanning the barcode, you will hear a “beep”. The beep indicates that the barcode has been successfully scanned. The voter’s name will appear in the name field. The <em>Status</em> indicates “Marked” and the <em>Status Reason</em> indicates “Ballot Returned”. If you do not see the correct voter’s name or the status/reason fields indicate anything other than “Marked” and “Ballot Returned”, call the team leader.</p>

<p>Step 6. Verify voter’s name on the VERIS screen. Have you located the correct voter?</p>

<p>Step 7. Confirm ballot status has been updated to “Marked”. A “Marked” status indicates that the voter’s ballot has been received at the Office of Elections.</p>

<p>Step 8. Place the scanned mailer, facedown, and begin a separate pile. By doing so, you will keep the scanned mailers separated from those awaiting scanning.</p>

  <div class="slide-summary">

        <!-- <p><strong>041. : Slide 41</strong></p> -->

        <p>Step 9. Continue scanning. The list of voters on the screen will grow longer each time a new mailer is scanned. Each time you scan, listen closely for a “beep”. Verify that the name on the mailer is the same name that appears on the VERIS screen, that the ballot <em>Status</em> is “Marked”, and that the <em>Status Reason</em> is “Ballot Returned”.</p>

<p>Once scanned, place each mailer, facedown, in the separated pile.</p>

<p>VERIS is programmed to allow 10 mailers to be batch scanned at one time. After you have successfully scanned 10 mailers, take one more look at the VERIS screen to reconfirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The count in the upper right corner shows 10</li>
  <li><em>Status</em> shows “Marked” for all voters</li>
  <li><em>Status Reason</em> shows “Ballot Returned” for all voters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 10. <strong>Click Save</strong>. This is a critical step! Place the 10 successfully scanned mailers in the “Saved in VERIS” table box.</p>

<p>Step 11. Continue this same process to scan the remaining mailers in your set. When scanning is complete, the “Saved in VERIS” table box will contain approximately 50 unopened mailers, still containing ballots; the status of each of these ballots has been updated to “Marked”.</p>

<p><strong>Problems?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Immediately notify the team leader if any mailer will not scan or an error message pops up on the computer.</strong></p>

        <p>As mentioned, you now have approximately 50 scanned mailers in the “Saved in VERIS” table box. Each voter’s status has been updated to “Marked”.</p>

<p>What’s next? It’s déjà vu all over again! You must now re-scan each of these mailers and update the voter’s status to “Pre-Processed”. The “Pre-Processed” status indicates that the voter’s <em>Statement of Absentee Voter</em> is complete and correct. The voter has fulfilled all requirements for his or her ballot to be counted.</p>

<p>Step 12. Remove all ballots from the “Saved in VERIS” table box. Re-scan the barcode on the first mailer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is this the correct voter?</li>
  <li>Ensure the voter’s ballot <em>Status</em> indicates “Pre-Processed”.</li>

  <li>Verify correct voter and “Pre-Processed” status as each mailer is scanned.</li>
  <li>Always remember to place scanned mailer, facedown, in the separated pile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember VERIS only allows batch scanning of up to 10 mailers/screen. Follow standard scanning procedures until 10 voters’ names appear on the screen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verify count of 10.</li>
  <li>Check the <em>Status</em> fields to ensure that “Pre-Processed” appears after each voter’s name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 14. <strong>CLICK SAVE</strong> at the bottom left-hand corner of the page. This is a critical step. Then, place the 10 scanned mailers in the “Saved in VERIS” table box.</p>

<p>Step 15. Continue process until all mailers in set have been scanned. Remember to scan one group of 10 mailers at a time and be sure to click “Save” at the end of each group.</p>

<p>As each group of 10 mailers is successfully processed and saved in VERIS, place the group in the “Saved in VERIS” table box. When you complete processing the entire set, you will have mailers from approximately 50 absentee voters in the table box. Each mailer has been carefully reviewed. The status of every one of these voters is now “Pre-Processed”.</p>

<p>The “No More Than 10 Rule” was instituted to minimize the amount of time spent on re-scanning.</p>

<p>And a word of warning! VERIS can be an unpredictable creature! It can be slow or even unavailable at times. Patience and flexibility will go a long way in helping you accomplish your job.</p>

        <p>Step 16. Remove the processed mailers from the “Saved in VERIS” table box. Place a green checkmark on the reverse side of every mailer (the voter statement side). The green check mark indicates that the process is complete. Now put a rubberband around the set of checked-in mailers and place the set in the green “Completed Bundles” tray.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>046. : Slide 46</strong></p> -->

        <p>Step 17. Your last task is to complete the Mailer Count worksheet to account for both the processed and not processed mailers in Set 1.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Record the number of mailers that were originally taken from the red tray, (probably 50) in the <em>Total Mailers at Start</em> column for Set 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you were evaluating the voter statement for material omissions, did you place any mailers in the “Not Processed” table box? Record this number in the <em>Not Processed Mailers</em> column for Set 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Count the number of processed mailers. Record this number in the <em>Processed Mailers</em> column for Set 1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The number of processed mailers + the number of not processed mailers = the number of mailers at start.</p>

<p>When these numbers reconcile, wrap the Not Processed mailers in a sheet of paper. Write the Bundle # and the Set # on the paper. Leave the wrapped Not Processed mailers in the “Not Processed” table box.</p>

        <p>Congratulations! You have successfully completed checking-in your first set of mailers with barcodes. That was easy…right?</p>

<p>But you’re not done yet. Grab another set of 50 mailers and let’s do it again.</p>

        <p>Periodically, you will not be able to use the “Batch”method to scan mailers and check voters into VERIS; for example, when receiving a mailer from a voter who has requested an email ballot.</p>

<p>As you have already learned, a voter living overseas or military personnel living anywhere may request to receive their ballot by email. The voter uses templates in a PDF attachment to create their ballot and their return mailer. Once printed, the voted ballot must be inserted into the return mailer and mailed back to the Office of Elections.</p>

<p>This mailer does <strong>not</strong> have a preprinted voter information label with a barcode. You will need to check this voter into VERIS manually.</p>

        <p>Once you select the correct voter from the search list, the Voter Overview page appears.</p>

<p>Verify that you have located the correct voter by comparing the name on the voter statement with the information on the VERIS screen. Do they match?</p>

<p>Do you have the correct election? The screen should display “2021 November General Election”. If the current election does not show, click on the drop-down arrow in the “Election” field and select the correct election.</p>

<p>Then ask yourself, was the voter sent an absentee ballot? If yes, <em>Status</em> will indicate “Issued”. If the <em>Status</em> does not say “Issued”, notify the team leader.</p>

<p>When you have confirmed that the information is correct, click on the pencil icon at the lower right of the screen, next to the “Issued” status. This will allow you to edit the voter’s record to show that the voter’s ballot was received.</p>

        <p>The left side of this slide shows the items that need to be edited and verified. We must ensure VERIS reflects the correct information for the voter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Confirm the <em>Ballot Received Date</em> is the same as the date stamped on the outside of the return mailer. If not, adjust the date by clicking on the calendar icon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>Received by Method</em> field defaults to “Mail” which means the return mailer was delivered by the post office or a commercial mail delivery service (UPS, FEDEX, DHL). If the return mailer was received from a voter drop off location, <em>Received by Method</em> should be changed to “Drop Off”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the <em>Status</em> from “Issued” to “Marked”. This means the voter has returned a voted ballot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click save. VERIS will then return you to the voter’s overview page which will reflect the changed voter status.</p>
